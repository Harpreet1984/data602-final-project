### Instacart Market Basket Analysis

This project is final course work for DATA602 (Advanced programming Techniques).
Instacart market basket analysis is kaggle competition launched to use the anonymized data gathered by Instacart on 
customer orders over time to predict which previously purchased products will be in a userâ€™s next order.

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/windows-installation.html

For MacOS:

https://sequelpro.com/docs/ref/mysql/install-on-osx

2) Graphlab:

## Url for App:

http://54.172.68.230:5000

## How it works:

The app is designed with two tabs:

### 1) Dashboard:
Dashboard mentions details three visuals and summary of dataset provided.

a) Orders by time of day.
b) Orders by time of week
c) Popular aisles in customers
 

### 2) Product Recommendations:
 Offers five recommended products(with product ID,Product,Department,Aisle) for customer selected from drop down tab.
 
 
## Prediction model:
We have used a recommender system to provide personalized recommendation to users. With this toolkit, we train a model based on past interaction data and use the model to make recommendations.

### Input Data
We have used following dataset to train the model  with columns that contain user_id and item_id.

This is the descriptive statistics of item_id data in dataset.

![Item Descriptive Stats](https://github.com/albert-gilharry/data602-final-project/blob/master/images/des_stats.jpg "Description goes here")

This graph show the distribution of the item_id

![Items Distribution](https://github.com/albert-gilharry/data602-final-project/blob/master/images/item_distribution.jpg "Description goes here")

This graph show the heat map chart between the various item and user id.

### Building a Model
There are a variety of machine learning techniques that can be used to build a recommender model. We have used graphlab module. For this project we have used item to item similarity recommender.

First we create a training dataset that will be used to train the model. Within the Order dataset there is a column eval_set that is used to determine the training set.
```
actionsTraining = actions[ actions["eval_set"] == "train"]
actionsTraining = actionsTraining.dropna(subset=['product_id'])
actionsTraining = actionsTraining[["user_id", "product_id"]]
actionsTraining.columns = ['user_id', 'item_id'  ]
actionsTraining["item_id"] = actionsTraining["item_id"].astype(int)
sf=gl.SFrame(actionsTraining)
```

Now we create a item similarity recommender and use this model to recommend top 5 recommendations.
```
item_similarity_recommender = gl.recommender.item_similarity_recommender.create(sf)
item_similarity_top_k = item_similarity_recommender.recommend(k=k)
```
## Built with:
